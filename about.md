Hello there!

Welcome to my personal blog. If you are wondering who am I and why I have
dedicated some time to write some articles, let me tell you a short story.

I graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Mechatronics Engineering. Maybe you are
wondering what career is that? Well, basically is the automation of different
systems (hardware, software and mechanical devices) so that they work together to
achieve a common goal. Halfway through my career I noticed that software
development was what I enjoyed doing the most from all the different areas
covered by my career. Ever since, I've tried to correct the path by
getting all the software experience that I can.

So this blog is to document all the journey that I'm going through
to become a great software developer. I believe that all the necessary
information is out there. You just have to go and get it!
